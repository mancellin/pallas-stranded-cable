Welcome to stranded-cable's documentation!
==========================================

**stranded-cable** is a python package proposed to evaluate stranded cables' physical characteristics. It can be easily done by defining the main characteristics of constitutive wires.

Stranded cables have many structural and engineering applications :
cable-stayed bridges, mooring lines, overhead
lines. **stranded-cable** can compute analytical and semi-analytical
components of the cable's behaviour.

**stranded-cable** is developed by `Eurobios Mews Labs <https://www.mews-partners.com/notre-offre/eurobios-mews-labs/>`_ and supported by `Rte-R&D <https://www.rte-france.com/>`_ *via* the OLLA project (see `ResearchGate <https://www.researchgate.net/project/OLLA-overhead-lines-lifespan-assessment>`_).
